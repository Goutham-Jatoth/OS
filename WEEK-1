WEEK-1 
Write C programs to simulate the following CPU Scheduling algorithms.  
a) FCFS  
b) SJF  
c) Round Robin  
d) Priority 
a)FCFS (First Come First Serve) 
Aim: Write a C program to implement the various process scheduling mechanisms such as FCFS scheduling. 
Algorithm: 
1: Start the process 
2: Accept the number of processes in the ready Queue 
3: For each process in the ready Q, assign the process id and accept the CPU burst time 
4: Set the waiting of the first process as ‘0’ and its burst time as its turn around time  
5: for each process in the Ready Q calculate 
a. Waiting time for process(n)= waiting time of process (n-1) + Burst time of process(n-1) 
b. Turnaround time for Process(n)= waiting time of Process(n)+ Burst time for process(n) 
6: Calculate  
a. Average waiting time = Total waiting Time / Number of process 
b. Average Turnaround time = Total Turnaround Time / Number of process 
7: Stop the process

Program:
#include<stdio.h> 
int  main() 
{ 
int bt[20],p[20],wt[20],tat[20],i,j,n,total=0,pos,temp; 
float avg_wt,avg_tat; 
printf("Enter number of process:"); 
scanf("%d",&n); 
printf("\nEnter Burst Time:\n"); 
for(i=0;i<n;i++) 
{ 
printf("p % d:",i+1); 
scanf("%d",&bt[i]); 
p[i]=i+1;           //contains process number 
} 
wt[0]=0;        
//waiting time for first process will be zero 
//calculate waiting time 
for(i=1;i<n;i++) 
{ 
wt[i]=0; 
for(j=0;j<i;j++) 
wt[i]+=bt[j]; 
total+=wt[i]; 
} 
avg_wt=(float)total/n;      //average waiting time 
total=0; 
printf("\nProcess\t Bturst Time  \tWaiting Time\tTurnaround Time");     
for(i=0;i<n;i++) 
{ 
tat[i]=bt[i]+wt[i];    
total+=tat[i]; 
 //calculate turnaround time 
printf("\np%d\t\t  %d\t\t    %d\t\t\t%d",p[i],bt[i],wt[i],tat[i]); 
} 
avg_tat=(float)total/n;     //average turnaround time 
printf("\n\nAverage Waiting Time=%f",avg_wt); 
printf("\nAverage Turnaround Time=%f\n",avg_tat); 
}
OUTPUT:
Enter number of process:4
Enter Burst Time:
p  1:5
p  2:2
p  3:6
p  4:1
Process	 Bturst Time  	Waiting Time	Turnaround Time
p1		  5		    0			5
p2		  2		    5			7
p3		  6		    7			13
p4		  1		    13			14
Average Waiting Time=6.250000
Average Turnaround Time=9.750000
b) SJF (Shortest Job First) 
Aim: Write a C program to implement the various process scheduling mechanisms such as SJF Scheduling. 
Algorithm: 
1: Start the process 
2: Accept the number of processes in the ready Queue 
3: For each process in the ready Q, assign the process id and accept the CPU burst time 
4: Start the Ready Q according the shortest Burst time by sorting according to lowest to highest burst time. 
5: Set the waiting time of the first process as ‘0’ and its turnaround time as its burst time. 
6: For each process in the ready queue, calculate 
(a) Waiting time for process(n)= waiting time of process (n-1) + Burst time of process(n-1) 
(b) Turn around time for Process(n)= waiting time of Process(n)+ Burst time for process(n) 
7: Calculate 
 Average waiting time = Total waiting Time / Number of process 
Average Turnaround time = Total Turnaround Time / Number of  process  
8: Stop the process

program

#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
    int n, i, j;
    int p[20], bt[20], wt[20], tat[20];
    int temp;

    printf("Enter number of processes: ");
    scanf("%d", &n);

    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        p[i] = i + 1;
        printf("Enter burst time for process %d: ", p[i]);
        scanf("%d", &bt[i]);
    }

    // Sorting processes by burst time (SJF)
    for (i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {
        for (j = i + 1; j < n; j++) {
            if (bt[i] > bt[j]) {
                temp = bt[i];
                bt[i] = bt[j];
                bt[j] = temp;

                temp = p[i];
                p[i] = p[j];
                p[j] = temp;
            }
        }
    }

    // Waiting time
    wt[0] = 0;
    for (i = 1; i < n; i++) {
        wt[i] = wt[i - 1] + bt[i - 1];
    }

    // Turnaround time
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        tat[i] = wt[i] + bt[i];
    }

  
    printf("\nProcess\tBurst Time\tWaiting Time\tTurnaround Time\n");
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        printf("P%d\t\t%d\t\t%d\t\t%d\n",  p[i], bt[i], wt[i], tat[i]);
